# WebGL-experiment
Learning WebGL basics using three.js

Parts of the code adapted from https://threejs.org/examples/

Some texture images are my own, others are from http://www.mb3d.co.uk/mb3d/maxTextures_Home_-_Free_Seamless_and_Tileable_High_Res_Textures.html and https://threejs.org/examples/. Thank you!
